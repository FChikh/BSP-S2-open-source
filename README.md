# BSP-2023-S02-Fedor-open-source-project

This is the source code of technical deliverable of BSP-S2 project by Fedor Chikhachev.

All files with the code are contained inside `.github/workflows` folder. There are several CI scripts, which performs a synchronisation workflow between 2 repositories, private and public. 

For the moment the code available here is working only for the specific pair of repositories ([sync-repos-public](https://github.com/FChikh/sync_repos_public) and [sync-repos-private](https://github.com/FChikh/sync_repos_private)), as some parts of code are related concretely to these repositories (e.g. their source addresses and API tokens with corresponding access rights). The access to these repositories is personal, as they contain some private information. So it is unavailable for the moment to probide a live demonstration for everybody. To see this software in action, please refer to video demonstrations in ST-VIDEO deliverable.

Also, this repository contains draft versions of LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING files for E4L project, as they were produced as a part of research.
